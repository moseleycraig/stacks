The BitBadge contract is a Bitcoin-verified NFT minting system that leverages Clarity's blockchain verification capabilities. It creates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can only be minted by the contract owner after confirming a specific Bitcoin transaction, adding a layer of cryptographic authenticity to the token creation process.

The contract's design ensures strict control over token generation and transfer. By requiring Bitcoin transaction verification during minting and enforcing ownership checks during transfers, it creates a secure, traceable mechanism for creating unique digital badges or tokens with provable origins directly linked to Bitcoin blockchain events.
