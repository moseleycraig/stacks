This stateless contract serves as a crucial verification layer for Bitcoin transactions within the Stacks ecosystem, enabling trustless cross-chain verification. The contract implements a comprehensive Bitcoin transaction parser and verification system that can read, decode, and verify Bitcoin transaction data, block headers, and merkle proofs. Each component is carefully designed to handle Bitcoin's specific data structures while maintaining strict type safety in Clarity.

The contract is structured in three main parts: transaction parsing, block header verification, and merkle proof validation. The transaction parsing component breaks down raw Bitcoin transaction data into its constituent parts (version, inputs, outputs, and locktime), handling various data types including variable-length integers (varints) and byte sequences. The block header verification ensures the provided block header matches the Bitcoin blockchain at the specified height, while the merkle proof validation confirms the transaction's inclusion in the block by reconstructing the merkle path from the transaction to the root.

Every step in the verification process is necessary to maintain Bitcoin's security guarantees within the Stacks ecosystem. The contract uses helper functions to handle Bitcoin's little-endian encoding, implements careful bounds checking, and provides comprehensive error handling for scenarios like oversized inputs or invalid proofs. This meticulous attention to detail ensures that Bitcoin transaction verification remains secure and reliable, making it a foundational component for cross-chain applications built on Stacks.
